Please help me to setup effective development environment on my Mac Mini + Amazon Q Developer (KIRO) + VS code. The code delopment is okay for today. I want to have environment where I can easily and quickly improve my text (Natural language text in English). I use Notion AI. This is a great application for me to jot down inproper English sentences and improve to beautufil sentense in one command "Improve text". I subscribed Amazon Q developer (KIRO) today. I like both AI but I need to save cost. I prefer to subscribe Amazon Q Developer (KIRO) and cancel Notion AI by the end of this month. Notion AI is great AI tool but I only use Improve text (90%). If Amazon Q Developer (KIRO) can do the same thing, I want to cancel Notion AI. As far as I understand Amazon Q Developer (KIRO) is effectively working in development environment, especially VS code. So, I wonder if I have a specific repo where I create only text based file like text and markdown file. Then I can jot down my idea and ask Amazon Q Developer (KIRO) to improve my text in VS code environment. This is just what I am thinking. It may be wrong. I'm sure you have better idea. So, please give me your advice and suggestion how I can create a good working environment using Amazon Q Developer (KIRO) in mac mini environment.
