# About Me

Hi! I'm Nobu, and I work with AI, cloud technologies, and modern development practices. I created this platform to share the practical solutions and insights I've gathered along the way.

## Why I Share This Knowledge

Throughout my career, I've benefited enormously from the generosity of developers and engineers who shared their knowledge online. Now I want to give back to that community. If my experience can save you time, help you solve a problem, or point you in the right direction, then this site has served its purpose.

## My Background

I currently work at a robotics company where I focus on integrating AI solutions into real-world applications. My day-to-day work involves:

- Implementing generative AI in business processes
- Building scalable AWS infrastructure
- Automating deployment and security workflows
- Solving integration challenges between different systems

## Technical Experience

| Area | What I Work With |
|------|------------------|
| **Cloud Platforms** | AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, Cognito, S3, EC2) |
| **AI & Automation** | Generative AI, AWS AI Services, Business Process Automation |
| **DevOps** | Docker, Nginx, CI/CD Pipelines, Infrastructure as Code |
| **Security** | SSL/TLS Configuration, Certificate Management, Authentication Systems |
| **Databases** | SQL Server, DynamoDB, Performance Optimization |
| **Development** | Python, API Development, Container Orchestration |
| **Tools** | Git, VS Code, Terraform, Azure DevOps |

## What You'll Find Here

### Practical Guides
Step-by-step solutions for real problems I've encountered:
- **AWS Configuration**: Working setups for various services
- **AI Implementation**: Practical approaches to integrating AI
- **DevOps Automation**: Scripts and processes that actually work
- **Security Setup**: SSL/TLS and authentication configurations
- **Troubleshooting**: Solutions to common (and not-so-common) issues

### My Approach
I focus on:
- **Practical over theoretical**: Real-world solutions that work
- **Concise explanations**: Get to the point quickly
