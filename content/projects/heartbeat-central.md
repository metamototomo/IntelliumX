## Background

The inspiration came from a simple family moment—receiving a blood pressure monitor from my mum. Based on my age, I started thinking about monitoring my health more systematically. 

Traditionally, elderly people check their blood pressure and manually log data in notebooks, then create line charts by hand. My dad does exactly this, and it works. But as a cloud engineer, I saw an opportunity to create something better—a digital solution that maintains the simplicity elderly users need while adding the power of modern technology.

This became the starting point for developing Heartbeat Central: a platform that bridges the gap between traditional health monitoring and modern digital convenience.
