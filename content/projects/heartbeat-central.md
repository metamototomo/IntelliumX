## Overview

Heartbeat Central is a personal health monitoring platform that simplifies blood pressure and body temperature tracking for elderly users and non-technical individuals. Built with AWS serverless architecture, it combines an intuitive user interface with enterprise-grade security, making health monitoring accessible to everyone.

## Background

The inspiration came from a simple family moment—receiving a blood pressure monitor from my parents. Based on my age, I started thinking about monitoring my health more systematically. 

Traditionally, elderly people check their blood pressure and manually log data in notebooks, then create line charts by hand. My dad does exactly this, and it works. But as a cloud engineer, I saw an opportunity to create something better—a digital solution that maintains the simplicity elderly users need while adding the power of modern technology.

This became the starting point for developing Heartbeat Central: a platform that bridges the gap between traditional health monitoring and modern digital convenience.

## Key Features

- **Elderly-Friendly Design** - Simple, intuitive interface optimized for non-technical users
- **Multi-Device Support** - Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- **Comprehensive Dashboard** - At-a-glance view of recent measurements and trends
- **Advanced Visualization** - Custom filtering and chart timeframes for detailed analysis
- **Table View** - Excel-style data view for various analytical purposes
- **Secure Authentication** - OAuth 2.0 with Amazon Cognito for enterprise-grade security
- **Cost Optimized** - Extremely cost-effective at less than $2 AUD/month for daily use
- **Zero Maintenance** - Fully serverless AWS architecture

## Real-World Usage

I use Heartbeat Central daily to track my blood pressure and body temperature. This real-world usage drives continuous improvements:

- **Daily Testing** - Every feature tested through actual use
- **Usability Refinements** - UI improvements based on daily interaction
- **Performance Monitoring** - Real-time feedback on system performance
- **Feature Evolution** - New capabilities added based on practical needs

## Conclusion

Heartbeat Central represents the intersection of personal need and professional expertise. It solves a real problem—making health monitoring simple and secure for everyone, especially elderly users who need it most.

The project demonstrates that powerful, enterprise-grade applications can be built with serverless architecture while maintaining affordability and accessibility. Most importantly, it's a platform I use daily, ensuring every feature serves a real purpose.

By combining intuitive design with robust security and cost-effective architecture, Heartbeat Central shows how technology can genuinely improve daily life for users of all technical backgrounds.
